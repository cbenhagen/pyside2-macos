# pyside2-macos

## Notes

> Q: Except pre-built binaries, which parts of the Qt install needs to be checked
> for an "as complete build" of PySide2 as possible?
>
> A: Aside from the platform, you might want to check charts, webengine, location, and script
> 
> Q: is this true for both 5.6 and 5.9 branches of PySide2?
>
> A: no, location needs to be checked in 5.6, but not in 5.9, and charts bindings are not
> present in 5.6 afaik
